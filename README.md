# Project INF583

This project is made by :
- Meryem Jaaidan
- Xavier Durand

The purpose is to use mapReduce algorithms (Hadoop, A.Spark, A.Spark streaming and thread) to perform complex operations.

## Files organisation

Files are organised as a maven project (pom.xml). The project is organised as follow :
- `src` folder contains all sources files (the package `A` contains the code for the part A, `B` for the part B, and `MatrixMultiplication` for the third question of the part B).
- `graph` contains data of graph
- `integers` contains data of integers

## Run 
To run the part A, we just have to run the main in the Main class. As we cannot create two JavaSparkContext, you have to comment one of the two lines to test part A.

To run the part B, you just have to go to the right file and run the main function.
